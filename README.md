Project Title:

The project brief was to create a Fruit Machine (Slot Machine) where the user would try to win as much money as possible. Upon pressing 'GO!', five or three columns of images will flash infront of the user and at their discretion, can press 'STOP' to reveal how much money - if any - they have won. There are two versions of the game that are visible on the home screen. One version is the traditional fruit machine and the other is the same concept but with card suit types.

Getting Started:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

Prerequisites:

To run the app, the user will need to install Android Studio. The user will then need to decide whether to install an Android emulater or use their own mobile device. Once these two have been installed and linked up correctly, the green play button will play the app within the chosen Android device.
